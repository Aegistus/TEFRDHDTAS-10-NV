  frames:
  - characterDialogue: Thanks for getting me my bone, mortal.
    responses:
    - So are you going to be my companion for the rest of the game?
  - characterDialogue: No, lol. Why would I do that? I'm not going to spend the rest
      of my existence following you, fighting for you, and carrying all your burdens
      just cause you brought me a bone.
    responses:
    - But you promised!
  - characterDialogue: Well too bad. Also I just got word from God that we don't
      have the budget in the game for a companion system.
    responses:
    - Aw man >:(
  - characterDialogue: I'll tell you what, though. I'll throw in 500 caps for your
      effort.
    responses:
    - Yay! :D
