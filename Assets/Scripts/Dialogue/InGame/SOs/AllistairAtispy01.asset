  - characterDialogue: Hey there, friend. Looking to make some bottlecaps?
    responses:
    - Do I!
    - No.
  - characterDialogue: Well I've got a job that needs doing. See that town over there?
      It's called Kiloton. I want it gone.
    responses:
    - Sure, I'm in!
    - This job seems morally questionable.
  - characterDialogue: I'll pay you 2,000 bottlecaps to get the job done. Do you
      accept.
    responses:
    - Man, I'd do it for less!
    - I'd like to bargain for a higher wage.
  - characterDialogue: Very good. Talk to the town mayor. He should tell you how
      to arm the bomb.
    responses:
    - But why do you want this town destroyed?
  - characterDialogue: Because I'm wearing red, and that means I'm evil! *maniacal
      laughing*
    responses:
    - Man, you sure are a three dimensional character with lots of moral depth!
