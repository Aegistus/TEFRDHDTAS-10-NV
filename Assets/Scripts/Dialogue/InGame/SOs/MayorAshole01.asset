  - characterDialogue: Hello there traveller! What can I do for you?
    responses:
    - Hi, I wanted to inquire about the bomb in the center of your town.
  - characterDialogue: Well, this town was founded 100 years ago, right after the
      bombs dropped. For whatever reason, this one never went off. We named the town
      Kiloton as a result.
    responses:
    - So do you guys like, worship it or something?
  - characterDialogue: "Worship it? It's an unexploded bomb, stupid. Why would somebody
      worship a bomb?\t"
    responses:
    - Hypothetically, how would somebody go about arming the bomb to explode?
  - characterDialogue: Well there's a big button that says "DO NOT PRESS" on it.
      That should do the trick!
    responses:
    - Awesome, thanks!
  - characterDialogue: Say, you're not planning to arm the bomb, are you?
    responses:
    - Yes
    - No (Yes, but later)
    - Sarcastic (Yes)
    - What?
  - characterDialogue: Hahaha, well good luck stranger!
    responses:
    - ...
