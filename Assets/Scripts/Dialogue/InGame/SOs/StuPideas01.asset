  - characterDialogue: Howdy stranger. What can I do you for?
    responses:
    - I have a letter for you.
  - characterDialogue: A letter? Who from?
    responses:
    - Your cousin, Hugh Jass
    - Your mom.
  - characterDialogue: Ah a letter from Hugh! Thanks so much courier. Here, have
      some bottle caps for your troubles.
    responses:
    - Bottle caps?
  - characterDialogue: Yeah, that's the currency we use out here in the Wasteland.

    responses:
    - Yes
    - No (Yes but later)
